## Why
- The current README groups setup, usage, and client instructions without a clear hierarchy, making it harder for new users to scan requirements vs. run modes.
- We need a structured quick-start path that emphasizes prerequisites, installation, and transport options before advanced configuration.

## What Changes
- Reorganize the README with a clearer introduction, prerequisites, installation, and usage sections.
- Split run instructions by transport style and highlight the recommended FastMCP invocation while keeping advanced Typer CLI guidance separate.
- Add navigation aids (table of contents) and clarify how to invoke the exposed shortcut tool payload.

## Impact
- Documentation only; no code or behavioral changes expected.

## Rollout / Adoption Plan
- Update the repository README and rely on existing release processes. No additional rollout steps needed.

## Open Questions
- None.
